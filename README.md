# Project Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook designed for data analysis tasks. The notebook demonstrates basic operations on a dataset using Python and popular libraries like `pandas`.

## Files in the Repository

- **project.ipynb**: The main notebook file containing the analysis code and documentation.
- **data.csv**: (Expected) The dataset used in the analysis. Ensure this file is available in the same directory as the notebook.

## Steps in the Notebook

1. **Setup**: Importing necessary libraries like `pandas` and loading the dataset.
2. **Initial Inspection**: Using functions such as `.head()` and `.tail()` to view the first and last rows of the dataset.
3. **Analysis**: Additional operations can be added based on specific data insights.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd <project_directory>
   ```

3. Install the required Python libraries (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   pip install pandas
   ```

4. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook project.ipynb
   ```

5. Ensure the file `data.csv` is present in the same directory to run the analysis successfully.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or later
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas

## Notes

- The notebook assumes that `data.csv` is available in the same directory.
- You can expand the analysis by adding more cells to perform data visualization, statistical analysis, or machine learning.
